  - Master theorem
  - Hornerâ€™s algorithm: rewrite sum as recursion
  - Moving average: reuse previously computed average
- Sorting Algorithms
  - Get best, worst, average, complexity, etc.
  - Insertion sort: inject new element one at a time. $W(n)=\Omega(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i)=\Omega(n^2)$
  - Merge sort: divide into sub arrays, sort them, then merge them. Uses recursion, nlogn
  - Quick sort: pick element, divide array into sub arrays less and greater, repeat on sub arrays. n^2
  - Bubble sort: pairwise ascending swaps, repeat globally until no swaps over the pass
- Equal probability character example
  - Search array of zero then non zero numbers: go by factor of 2, on first hit search in between by halves. Logn

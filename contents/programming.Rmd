      - adding elements to list
        - 'insert' method requires index for where to insert a single item

    - tuple
      - ordered, unchangeable, allow duplicates
      - round brackets
    - set
      - curly brackets or 'set' constructor (ex. {1, 2 ,3} vs set((1, 2, 3)))
      - undordered, unindexed, no duplicates
      - can contain different data types
      - unchangeable, but extendable 
        - 'add' method for one item
        - 'update' method for extending by another set (or list, dictionary)
        - 'union' method takes union
        - 'intersection_update' method takes intersection
        - 'intersection' same as above but creates new set
        - 'symmetric_difference_update' method returns items not in both sets
        - 'symmetric_difference' method makes new seth
        - 'difference' method
      - removing
        - 'remove' method throws error if missing
        - 'discard' method throws no error
        - 'pop' method removes last item
        - 'clear' method empties the set
        - 'del' keyword deletes entirely
      - can use 'in' to check if variable in set
      - can loop through set
      
    - dictionary
    - strings
      - strings are arrays, so they are loopable
      - can use 'in' or 'not in' to search within string
      - 'upper' and 'lower' methods
      - concat using '+'
      - 'format' method allows variables of non string type to be converted to string and inserted in string

      - concat: ''.join(my_string)
      - find (see hackerrank in string example), be careful with starting and ending indices
      - string comparison: 'ab' < 'ba - how is it working

  - Range vs. xrange, iterators, list(range()), https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/range-vs-xrange-python/
    - starts at 0
    - second arg goes to n-1
    - backward range range(m-2, -1, -1)
  - recursion

  - mod %
  - Re-write EWMA in python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - tensorflow
  - Importing, namespaces
  - global vs. local variables (ex. )
    - global created outside function, but usable inside unless overridden by local
    - local created inside function
      - to create global variable inside function use 'global' keyword 
      - this overrides any preexisting same-named global variable
  - zip
  - enumerate
  - map
    - applies function to iterables

  - Big-O notation
  - $\Omega$ notation
  - $\Theta$ notation
  - Master theorem
  - Hornerâ€™s algorithm: rewrite sum as recursion
  - Moving average: reuse previously computed average

- binary search

- Sorting Algorithms
  - Get best, worst, average, complexity, etc.
  - Insertion sort: inject new element one at a time. $W(n)=\Omega(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i)=\Omega(n^2)$
  - Merge sort: divide into sub arrays, sort them, then merge them. Uses recursion, nlogn
  - Quick sort: pick element, divide array into sub arrays less and greater, repeat on sub arrays. n^2
  - Bubble sort: pairwise ascending swaps, repeat globally until no swaps over the pass
  - bucket sort (bin sort)
    - average and worst case complexity
    - use case: input uniformly distributed over a range
  - comparison sort
  
- Equal probability character example
  - Search array of zero then non zero numbers: go by factor of 2, on first hit search in between by halves. Logn

  - what are they
  - why are they used
- hash maps (java in capstone interview)

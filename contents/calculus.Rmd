# Calculus {#calc}

- Product rule
- Quotient rule
- Chain rule
- Integration by substitution (u-substitution)
- Substitution by definite integrals
- Integration by parts
  - how to recognize when to use
  - $\int udv=uv-\int vdu$
  - Ex. integral of $\ln{x}$
  - ex. application to compute variance of integral of BM
  - prob in poisson process
  - ex. static replication Implied vol Lecture 10 Slide 25
- log rules
- liebnitz rule (stoch calc)
- Euler's formula
- Geometric series - substitution trick
  - Applications: trend weight normalization
- Limits to infinity
  - Repetition trick for $e$ and continuous compounding (related to foundations of FE): $e^x=\lim_{n\to\infty}(1+\frac{x}{n})^n$
- Taylorâ€™s formula & Taylor series
  - application to first step analysis in stoch models
- First order condition
- Lagrange multiplier
- gradient
- hessian, jacobian (relate to linalg)
- curl
- triangle inequality
- trapezoidal rule in integration
- polar coordinates (reference box mueller in foundations, normal distribution in prob theory)
- L'Hopital's rule
- change of variables
- harmonic mean
  - definition
  - implied vol is harmonic avg of local vol (for short expirations)
  - used in schweser CFA Level 1 Book 1 for computing average cost of shares over time
    - ex. $1000 stock each month, $8, $9, $10 over 3 months
    - normally would find # of stocks bought each month then find total # of shares over 3 months, then use that as weights on 8, 9, 10
    - harmonic mean can be used instead
    - notation
    - relate to geometric and arithmetic
    - dollar cost averaging?
  - official CFA Level 1 Book 4
    - average price multiples

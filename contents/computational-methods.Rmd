# Computational Methods {#compmethods}

- Fast fourier transform
- Characteristic function
- Relate gamma to chi square distribution
- trapezoidal rule
- pricing with cosine method
- stratified sampling
- Kalman filtering
  - related to hidden markov model
  - gaussian distribution assumption
  - hidden (unobservable) continuous process evolves
  - extended kalman filter
    - ex. GIR defines cycles using residual on extended kalman filter of US GDP, wages taken from US tax dat
  - unscented kalman filter
  - applications to model fitting?

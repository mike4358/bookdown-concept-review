# Linear Algebra {#linalg}

- Angle: $\cos{\theta}=\frac{x^Ty}{\|x\|\|y\|}$
- Orthogonal is when dot product is 0
- Corr is cosine of angle between them in Euclidean
- Determinants of matrix
- Characteristic equation of matrix 
- Positive semidefinite/positive definite
  - relation to cholesky (psd always cholesky decomposible)
  - how can i tell if psd
  - relation to invertibility
- inner product
- outer product
- LU decomp
- Cholesky decomp
  - Application for monte carlo simulation for correlated random normal
- PDP decomp
- QR decomp
- UDU decomp?
- Diagonalization
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors: needs square
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - used in power meth for eigen
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
  - related to data analysis application
- Symmetric Matrix
- L1 l2 norms
- Basis
- linear transformation
- spanning
- orthogonal projection
- Invertible Matrix Theorem
- Gram-schmidt orthonormalization
- matrix rank, full rank
- jacobian matrix, hessian
- commutable matrix: AB=BA, what if one of them is identity matrix I?

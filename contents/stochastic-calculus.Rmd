- brownian motion
  - lecture 1
  - relate to other courses
  - discrete time random walk motivation
    - description
    - drawbacks
  - list of conditions that need to hold
    - check these properties for other processes (not just W_t)
    - examples?
  - lim property of differentiation (proof)
  - motivation for continuous time
    - vs discrete time
- probability space
  - definition
  - omega - sample space (relate to prob theory) of exhaustive (mutually exclusive) things that could happen
  - F - sigma algebra - collection of subsets of omega st certain set conditions hold
  - P - probability space - maps F to 0, 1 again with some conditions
- filtration
  - applied on a probability space
  - describes how information evolves over time
  - do the notation
  - definition: family of sigma fields (all F_t for t>=0)
  - application: often filtration is chosen to be info generated over time is generated by a brownian motion
- stochastic differential equations (SDE)
  - example: population growth model
    - chose to model population growth of unknown starting size with a constant drift term and random component
    - two random components
      - initial starting
      - noise term
  - formal form
    - $dX_t=\mu\left(t,X_t\right)dt+\sigma\left(t,X_t\right)dW_t,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ X_0=X_0\left(\omega\right)$
    - change = deterministic part (drift) + diffusion part
- diffusion process
  - solution of SDE is called a diffusion process X_t (aka diffusion process satisfies the SDE)
  - usually X_0 known in financial applications (ex. starting stock price)
  - continuity of a diffusion process
    - definition: all sample paths/trajectories are continuous
    - continuous for all outcomes
    - look up shreve, point?
  - strong solution to SDE is diffusion process X_t st:
    - why do we want this?
    - X_t continuous
    - prob starting point = X^o =1
    - integral of abs val of drift & diffusion parts < infty wp 1 (what is this called & why)
    - X_t a function of X_0, integral drift, and integral diffusion (see stochastic integral)
- quadratic variation
  - used in stoch integrals
  - refer to shreve
  - def: new process defined to be sum of all squared (continuous) original process differences as max partition size goes to zero
  - if original process is brownian motion, new process goes to T almost surely (see data analysis)
  - levy's thoerem
    - super important to link martingales with brownian motions
    - if M(t) martingale has quad var t, then it's a brownian motion
    - proof shreve?
    - used in ito - box calc - dWdW = dt
  - estimating using realized variance
- quadratic covariation
  - similar steps as quadratic var, but with two variables
  - ultimately results in dWdZ = 0

  - relate to stoch models

- change of measure
  - motivation: alter the dynamics of SDE to make process (discounted asset prices) a martingale. then expectation of that should be price today by def of martingale
